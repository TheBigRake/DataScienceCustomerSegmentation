# Data Science Customer Segmentation Project
## Introduction
#### When marketing to customers, different groups have different unique messaging needs. One form of segmentation is RFM which stands for Recency, Frequency, Monetary. This means breaking up customers into clusters based on how recent their purchases took place, how many purchases they have made, and the monetary level of their purchases. With these clusters, you can customize the messages these customers receive when logged into their account, the promotions they receive via text or e-mail, and the effectiveness of types of messaging across subgroups i.e. A/B testing a promotion. 
### The Data
#### The data provided contained the entirety of purchases and returns for an online retailer over a period of a little more than 1 year. Included are the Invoice Number, StockCode, Description, Invoice Date, Unit Price, Customer ID, and Country. The data was received in a CSV form, allowing for segregation and manipulation.
